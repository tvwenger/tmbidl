	TMBIDL v8.0 - Installation Instructions
======================================================================

A new installation of TMBIDL begins by obtaining the latest version of
TMBIDL from the TMBIDL Github repository. For instructions on
using GIT, read 00GIT.

After obtaining the latest version of TMBIDL, follow these
instructions.

======================================================================

1. Obtain the default IDL path for your IDL installation. To do so,
start vanilla IDL and print the !path system variable ie:

$ idl
IDL> print,!path

Copy the output of the !path system variable. Modify the following
files:

startup/TMBIDL.INIT
startup/TMBIDL.INIT.TCSH
startup/TMBIDL.INIT.BASH

by replacing the DEFAULT_IDL_PATH environment variable value with the
path you copied from IDL. For example, in the TMBIDL.INIT and
TMBIDL.INIT.TCSH, the line should be

setenv DEFAULT_IDL_PATH <output from IDL !path>

In the TMBIDL.INIT.BASH file, the line should be

export DEFAULT_IDL_PATH=<output from IDL !path>

======================================================================

2. Set the location of your TMBIDL installation by modifying the 
following files

startup/TMBIDL.INIT
startup/TMBIDL.INIT.TCSH
startup/TMBIDL.INIT.BASH

and replacing the LOCAL_TMBIDL environment variable value with the
path to your TMBIDL installation. For example, if my TMBIDL
installation was in the directory /idl/tmbidl/, I would edit
TMBIDL.INIT and TMBIDL.INIT.TCSH to be

setenv LOCAL_TMBIDL /idl/tmbidl/

and TMBIDL.BASH to be

export LOCAL_TMBIDL=/idl/tmbidl/

======================================================================

3. Set up aliases to start TMBIDL. If you are using TCSH, add the
following line (you may call it whatever you want) to your ~/.tcshrc
or ~/.tcsh_profile file:

alias inittmbidl 'cd /path/to/tmbidl/startup ; source TMBIDL.INIT ; idl ; cd -'

where /path/to/tmbidl is the path to your TMBIDL installation. For
example, if TMBIDL is install in /idl/tmbidl that alias should be

alias inittmbidl 'cd /idl/tmbidl/startup ; source TMBIDL.INIT ; idl ; cd -'

If you are using BASH, add the following line to your ~/.bashrc
or ~/.bash_profile file:

alias inittmbidl='cd /path/to/tmbidl/startup ; source TMBIDL.INIT ; idl ; cd -'

======================================================================

Your TMBIDL installation is now complete. It is recommended that you
now perform initial tests to ensure that your TMBIDL installation
is working properly. To perform these tests, start TMBIDL using the
alias you just created (you may need to "source" your .tcshrc or
.bashrc file first) via:

$ inittmbidl

You should see a long list of

% Compiled module: <something>

statements followed by:

these installation tests, track down the cause of the error message
and fix the problem.
