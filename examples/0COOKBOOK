 COOKBOOK EXAMPLES FOR TMBIDL V7.0: GBT ACS AND DCR DATA 
============================================================
First, you need to attach the relevant data files to TMBIDL.
See ../tmbidl/examples/00README for instructions. 
============================================================
This gives you access to to GBT ACS spectral line data 
for the 3-Helium experiment's session number 76 for project
AGBT12A_114.  The H II regions W3 and S206 were observed
in TP mode with the ACS tuned to 8 different frequencies
at two orthogonal polarizations for a total of 16 spectra
per PS OffOn pair.  So each GBT ACS PS observation yields 
16 TMBIDL spectra that are the basic TMBIDL data unit, 
a "record".

===================
============================================================
RUN THE FOLLOWING IDL BATCH FILE TO SEE THE FINAL RESULT 
OF WHAT YOU ARE ABOUT TO LEARN :
TMBIDL--> @../../examples/examples.pro
============================================================

To look at these data issue the follow commands at the
TMBIDL==> command line.  All TMBIDL commands have a /help
keyword.  Check this out with 'online,/help'.  When you
ask for /help that is all you get -- help.  The command
is NOT executed.
============================================================

online         <== points TMBIDL to the ONLINE data file
list,400,431   <== gives info anent the 32 ACS spectra for 
                   a single OffOn TP pair made on W3

DISPLAY SPECTRA
===============
fetch,431     <== get ON record 431 from ONLINE, find its
                  associated OFF and calculate the TP 
                  spectrum.  
xx           <==  display the spectrum which is for the 
                  RR polarization of the 'rx8' ACS tuning
xroll        <==  you are looking at all 4096 data points
                  this commands throws away 5% of the 
                  channels at both ends to mask filter

=======================
AVERAGING SPECTRAL DATA
=======================
tellset        <== gives search parameters for SELECTing
                   spectra from the ONLINE data file. 
                   Selected spectra are added to the STACK.
setsrc,'W3'   <==  search for W3 data
settype,'ON'  <==  search for ON source spectra
setid,'rx2'   <==  search for ACS rx2 tuning 
tellset       <==  check search parameters
                   '*' wildcard means both LL and RR
                   polarizations will be found 
select        <==  search ONLINE for matches, putting
                   matched record numbers in the STACK
tellstk       <==  print these matched record numbers
cat           <==  CATalog info about spectra in the STACK
                   There are 16 spectra that match the 
                   selection criteria stemming from 8 
                   TP OffOn observations at LL and RR
                   polarizations.
avgstk       <==   averages contents of STACK
                   currently defaults to displaying this average
xx           <==   display this 190.7 minute integration
setx,1500,3000 <== set x-axis channel range
xx
rrlflag      <==  this is the H91 alpha RRL transition
                  He91alpha and C91alpha are there 
                  H154 epsilon as well
dcsub       <==   subtract the average of the spectrum
                  from itself "DCsubtract"
xx
scaley      <==   make the y-axis choice pretty
xx
zline       <==   draw zero intensity

clearset    <==   restores SELECTion parameters to wild cards
tellset     <==   confirm the validity of this assertion 

==================
REMOVING BASELINES  
==================
This example assumes you have the spectrum generated above 
displayed in channels.

freey <== let y-axis range float
avgstk
setx,1500,3000
rrlflag

nrset,/help <==   information on how to define the NREGIONs
                  used to mask the data for a baseline model fit
nrset,4     <==   set 4 NREGION masks which requires 8 mouse clicks
nron        <==   turn on NREGION display boxes that are 3 sigma
                  high based on RMS inside the boxes
xx
bbb,3      <==    fits third order baseline to data in the 
                  NREGION boxes, pauses (needs <CR>), and
                  then subtracts

bb,3 <== invokes nrset in GBTIDL mode and then does bbb

=================
FITTING GAUSSIANS
=================

==> A baseline MUST be removed before attempting any Gaussian
    fits.  That is, the mean of the data inside the NREGION
    boxes must be zero.

Starting with the baseline removed spectra from the above 
example, change the y-axis units to milliKelvins 

mk
xx

==> since W3's H91 alpha like is over 3K, focus instead on
    He and C 91 alpha by resetting the y-axis range:

sety,-50,450
xx
setx,1500,2300  <==  concentrate on the He and C lines
xx
zline <== draw line at zero intensity
rrlflag

gg,/help <==  info on how to fit gaussians 

xx
gg,2  <== fit 2 gaussians for the C and He line
          no need to be too anal vis a vis your mouse
          clicks as this is a Marqwardt fitter and hence
          is very robust.

Here are my fits.  Yours should be very close to these.

=========================
CHANGING THE X-AXIS UNITS
=========================

This far we've stayed in CHANNELS.  TMBIDL recognizes the following x-axis units for spectra:

chan
velo
freq  

All of the procedures described thus far work for any x-axis definition.
Be sure, however, to use the correct units when invoking any commands....!!!

velo
xx     <==  change x-axis to LSR velocity.  This is only correct if the source velocity
            Vsrc shown on the graph header is correct 
setx,-200,75
