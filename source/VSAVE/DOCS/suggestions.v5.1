TMB,

As I contemplate merging new material in I have some suggestions.

When copying over a new version a minumum of files should have to be
modified in the copied version.

STARTUP.IDL.V5.1 should be made more vanilla.

     statements specific to a specific task like lfile=stuff should be
     collected in separate files like STARTUP.MR08 for things we might
     all be using. Individual STARTUP packages should be put in each
     individual's directory, eg, ../rtr/startup.te since we may have
     more than one.

COMPILE.TMBIDL.V5.1

     This should contain only the basics. One is presumedly running in
     the v5.1 subdirectory so eg

              .compile ../v5.1/findpol should become .compile findpol

     We should begin to move toward packages. So eg GRS and Arecibo
     specific pro should be moved to COMPILE.GRS COMPILE.BOZO etc

     Parhaps introduce startup files like STARTUP.GRS which would
     invoke COMPILE.GRS and define system variables specific to
     GRS. I'm trying to write my new stuff so that it can work in that
     way. 

Try to avoid fully qualified file names where ever possible. Using
names like ../nsave/saves.mr08 works well and is installation
independent. 

I suggest adding a new standard subdirectory in the idl subdirectory
called tables. This would contain tables of things like calibration
factors.
