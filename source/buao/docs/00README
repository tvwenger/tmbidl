====================================================
THERE IS VERY LITTLE CODE WRITTING FOR BUAO ANALYSIS
====================================================

There is, however, a lot of  FORTRAN code to be found 
on NINKASI at BU in /idl/buao/buao/for/

just how much of this might be worth the effort of
rewriting into IDL is currently unknown.

====================================================
Here are the .pro's in ../buao/pro/  
As yet, none of them has been brought up to v7.0
programming standard. (Save for a few edits needed 
to make them run.)

getlb.pro -   Syntax: getlb,gl,gb,nrec
=========     ========================
              Takes input gl,gb and gets the nearest
              BUAO spectrum to this position. Returns
              nrec which is the sequential file record
              number of this spectrum in the survey
              data file.
        ==>   Note the identical .pro name to GRS equivalent...

map9.pro -    Fetch and overplot the 8 nearest neighbor spectra
========      to input spectrum specified by its NREC position. 
              Note that NREC=!b[0].scan_num           

buao_survey.pro - THIS WILL NOT RUN AS GLOBALS ARE SET ELSEWHERE  
===============   Originally defined and set survey parameter 
                  globals for the next .pro

survey.pro -  Makes a plot of the survey lgal,bgal 
==========    coverage.  Is based on the values of
              the BUAO GLOBALS set elsewhere. It
              runs.  IF correct, it suggests that
              we don't have anywhere near the 
              entire survey.  Bummer. 

hisa.pro -    Beginning of HI Self-Absorption analysis.
========      Based on v3.2 code. Plots spectra nearest
              input position.  square girds. 3x3 default
              and 5x5 is current maximum




==> BUAO Survey data had to be converted from their native
    DEC VAX VMS FORTRAN Direct Access file format to TMBIDL.
    These .pro's did that although tmb had not confirmed that
    these are a complete set.  Hopefully, we shall never have
    need to use them ever again...

test.pro -      Beginning of task of figuring out VAX file...
========        No longer needed.

buao_data.pro - Reads input BuAO VAX data file.  Alas, takes
=============   this filename as input so cannot know it. 

buao_hdr.pro  - Same as above but read only the header. 
============    BUT it says file='/home/bania/buao/survey/survey.dat'
                which suggests that this was the VAX file...

buao.pro -      The above were used to figure things out.
========        This is the code that did the translation
                of the file named above.  It invokes:

buao2gbt.pro -  This does the AO to TMBIDL conversion on a 
============    record by record basis. 

make_buao_online.pro - Converts VAX file into TMBIDL ONLINE file.
====================   Go figure?  Not needed now. 

start_buao.pro - Unnecessary.  Replaced by 
==============   ../tmbidl/v7.0/start/start_BUAO.pro

=====================================================================
==> Finally:

atv.pro - ancient 1.5 2004 version of famous interactive   
=======   display tool for astronomical images
          see www.physics.uci.edu/~barth/atv
          It is not clear why this was in the buao directory...
